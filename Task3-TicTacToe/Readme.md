<h1>Task3-TicTacToe</h1>
<p align="justify"> Welcome to the TicTacToe Game repository! This classic game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to place their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three symbols before your opponent does. With features such as win detection, draw detection, and replay functionality, this game offers an engaging and interactive gaming experience.</p>

## Features:

- Two-Player Mode: Compete against a friend in a two-player mode, taking turns to place X and O symbols on the board.

- Win Detection: The game automatically detects when a player has formed a winning line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and displays a message box announcing the winner.

- Draw Detection: If the game ends in a draw (i.e., all cells on the board are filled without a winner), a message box appears to notify the players.

- Replay Functionality: After the game concludes, players are prompted to decide whether they want to play again. If they choose to replay, the board is reset for a new game.
